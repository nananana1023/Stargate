# Stargate game

## Description of the Game

"Stargate: The IK-1 Mission" is a cooperative game designed for 1 to 4 players, where the team must work together to find crucial parts of a crashed scout plane hidden in the sand on a 5x5 board. The ultimate goal is to recover all the parts before anyone runs out of water.

## Game Setup

### Board Layout

- **Size**: 5x5 grid.
- **Features**: 
  - Four squares show oases (only three are real water bodies; one is a mirage).
  - The rest of the squares are covered in sand.

### Player Actions

Players can take up to three actions per turn:
- **Move**: Move to an adjacent square (up, down, left, right, but not diagonally).
- **Dig**: Dig up the space you are standing on to potentially reveal clues, parts, or determine if an oasis is real or a mirage.

### Oases

- When a player digs at an oasis for the first time:
  - If it's a water reservoir, it refills the player's water supply to six units.
  - If it's a mirage, no changes occur to the player's water supply.

### Clues and Parts

- **Clues**: Digging up a clue reveals either the row or the column of a part.
- **Parts**: Once clues for a part are found, players can dig at the intersection to retrieve the part.

### Rounds and Water Consumption

- Each round consists of each player taking three actions.
- At the end of each round, each player's water supply decreases by one unit.

## Winning the Game

- **Victory**: Players win by finding all three parts before anyone's water supply runs out.
- **Defeat**: The game is lost if any player runs out of water or if all parts are not recovered in time.
